How to build the program:   make all to build goatmalloc binary
                            make clean to remove goatmalloc binary
                            

Program Source:			goatmalloc.c, goatmalloc.h, test_goatmalloc.c

Results:

TODO

Test Procedures:	make clean
                    make

STILL TODO:

update prints to match format spec by project Description
get rid of compile errors
.h file issues w/ size_t
find out what binary should be called
