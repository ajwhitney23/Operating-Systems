Version:			V1.0
Project ID:			Project 1
CS Class:			CS3013
Programming Language:		C
OS/Hardware dependencies:	how does the program rely on the operating system,
				   or on the hardware?

Problem Description:		a statement of the requirements

Overall Design:			main design decisions about the program
	System structure	
	Data representation	
	Algorithms 		

Program Assumptions 
      and Restrictions:		seed.txt, seed_x_x.txt files must be present

Interfaces:			how the program interacts with users, data or programs
	User
	File/D-B
	Program/Module

Implementation Details:
	Data			implementation details of data representation
	Variables		key variables and their scopes
	Algorithm		implementation details of algorithm(s) used

How to build the program:	make all to build all binaries
                            make clean to remove all binaries
                            make prolific to build prolific binary
                            make generation to build generation binary
                            make slugs to build slug and slugrace binary

Program Source:			prolific.c, generation.c, slug.c, slugrace.c

Additional Files:		seed.txt, seed_slug_1.txt, seed_slug_2.txt, seed_slug_3.txt, seed_slug_4.txt

Results:			listing of sample run(s) of the program

Test Procedures:		how the program was tested
Test Data:			test cases

Performance Evaluation:		how well the program performs
	Time/Space
	User Interface
