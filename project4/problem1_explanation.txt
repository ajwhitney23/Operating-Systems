Our solution prevents thread starvation by having the last thread of a full 
stage (or last of it's type) recalcuate the probabilty of picking
which type of performer goes on stage next. This probabilty is calcuated
per group using two factors, how many of the type is left, and how many of
the other types is currently on stage. A number is then randomly selected 
by the thread between the range of all three odds added together.  If the number 
is in the range of the group, it goes next. The thread then sets a global variable 
which contains the id of the next group.
